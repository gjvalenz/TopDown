TopDown is a 2D TopDown game created by me!

I will slowly build it out over time, as I hope to make it a story-based game with magical elements
inspired by games like Pokemon and Wizard101.

To run it: Simply download this repo, enter the src directory, and run main.py using python.
Note: pygame is required.
